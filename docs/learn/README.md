# Getting Help

Writing distributed applications is hard, and sometimes you need help. There are several ways to get in touch with the developers behind MassTransit. In most cases, you can expect a response within a few days, sometimes sooner. The speed of the response is going to depend upon how well you've done your homework before raising the white flag.

However, before attempting to contact a developer directly, there are many active forums for support that are available.

## Stack Overflow

There is a MassTransit tag on [Stack Overflow][1], which has many questions that have already been asked. Several developers regularly monitor this tag for new questions, so that's a great place to start. Be sure to search and see if your question has already been asked, that is the fastest way to an answer if someone else has already experienced the same issue.

Before you just post your question, however, spend a few moments to compose your thoughts and formulate your question. There is nothing as pointless as simply telling us "MassTransit does not work for me" with no further information to give any clue to why. Before you post, search the web to see if your question has already been asked or even answered. And if it has been, you will already have your answer.

## GitHub Discussions

Questions, ideas, and suggestions can be posted on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MassTransit/MassTransit/discussions). Similar to Stack Overflow, but integrated with GitHub, this is a great place to post code samples, share ideas, and get help using MassTransit. The same guidelines above apply to discussions.

> If you have an issue _using_ MassTransit, this is the place to start **before** creating an issue.

## Discord

MassTransit has an active Discord server, which is a great place to get quick answers to short questions as well as share in engaging conversations about MassTransit, messaging, or whatever.

## Twitter

You might be able to get some attention on Twitter, and you're highly encouraged to tweet about MassTransit. Feel free to tag `@mtproj` (strangely, MassTransit is a noisy search term -- go figure).

## GitHub Issues

Please **do not open an issue on GitHub**, unless you have spotted an actual bug in MassTransit. If you are unsure, pursue one of the alternate options first. If we confirm it's a bug, we'll ask you to [create the issue][3].

**Issues are not the place for questions, and they'll likely be closed.**

This policy is in place to avoid bugs being drowned out in a pile of sensible suggestions for future enhancements and calls for help from people who forget to check back if they get it and so on.
