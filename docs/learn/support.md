may generate insights to drive architecture decisions. Determine the feasibility of leveraging a message broker in your application and which broker is
appropriate for your target platform.

### Code Review

Ensuring the appropriate use of MassTransit consumers, sagas, routing slips, consistent message contract design, and proper configuration early in a project is
the best way to deliver a consistent and maintainable application.
