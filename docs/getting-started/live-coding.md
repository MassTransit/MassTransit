# Live Coding

Chris Patterson ([@PhatBoyG](https://twitter.com/PhatBoyG)) has begun production of a video series. Each episode is a live, all-code experience covering MassTransit's extensive capabilities.

> These videos were started in response to the COVID-19 crisis when many communities were put under _shelter in place_ orders. To make good use of the time (and to avoid binge watching yet another B-series on Netflix), this series was started as a learning resources to share with others in the same situation.

Episodes are broadcast in 1080p60, and are a continuous journey through the creation of a fictitious order and inventory management solution.
