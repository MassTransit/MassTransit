# PostgreSQL Quick Start

> This tutorial will get you from zero to up and running with [SQL](/documentation/transports/sql) and MassTransit. 

> Walkthrough Video TBD

- The source for this sample is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/MassTransit/Sample-GettingStarted).

## Prerequisites

::alert{type="info"}
The following instructions assume you are starting from a completed [In-Memory Quick Start](/quick-starts/in-memory)
::

This example requires the following:

- a functioning installation of the dotnet runtime and sdk (at least 6.0)
- a functioning installation of _Docker_ with _Docker Compose_ support enabled.

## Run PostgreSQL

For this quick start, we recommend running the preconfigured [official Docker image of Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres). 

```bash
$ docker run -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

If you are running on an ARM platform

```bash
$ docker run --platform linux/arm64 -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

Once its up and running you can use your preferred tool to browse into the database.

## Configure PostgreSQL

Add the _MassTransit.SqlTransport.PostgreSQL_ package to the project.

```bash
$ dotnet add package MassTransit.SqlTransport.PostgreSQL
```

### Edit Program.cs

Change _UsingInMemory_ to _UsingPostgres_ as shown below.

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
        {
            services.AddOptions<SqlTransportOptions>().Configure(options =>
            {
                  options.Host = "localhost";
                  options.Database = "sample";
                  options.Schema = "transport";
                  options.Role = "transport";
                  options.Username = "masstransit";
                  options.Password = "H4rd2Gu3ss!";
                  
                  // credentials to run migrations
                  options.AdminUsername = "migration-user";
                  options.AdminPassword = "H4rderTooGu3ss!!";
            });
            // MassTransit will run the migrations on start up
            services.AddPostgresMigrationHostedService();
            services.AddMassTransit(x =>
            {
                // elided...

                x.UsingPostgres((context,cfg) =>
                {
                    cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
                });
            });

            services.AddHostedService<Worker>();
        });
```

| Setting         | Description                                                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Host`          | The host to connect to. We are using `localhost` to connect to the docker container       |
| `Port`          | We are using the default `5432`, so we aren't setting it.                                 |
| `Database`      | The name of the database to connect to                                                    |
| `Schema`        | The schema to place the tables and functions inside of                                    |
| `Role`          | the role to assign for all created tables, functions, etc.                                |
| `Username`      | The username of the user to login as for normal operations                                |
| `Password`      | The password of the user to login as for normal operations                                |
| `AdminUsername` | The username of the admin user to login as when running migration commands                |
| `AdminPassword` | The password of the admin user to login as when running migration commands                |


## Run the Project

```bash
$ dotnet run
```

The output should have changed to show the message consumer generating the output (again, press Control+C to exit). Notice that the bus address now starts with _db_.

```
Building...
info: MassTransit[0]
      Configured endpoint Message, Consumer: GettingStarted.MessageConsumer
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.

      Hosting environment: Development

      Content root path: /Users/chris/Garbage/start/GettingStarted

      Bus started: db://localhost/
info: GettingStarted.MessageConsumer[0]
      Received Text: The time is 3/24/2021 12:11:10 PM -05:00
```

At this point the service is connecting to PostgreSQL on _localhost_ and publishing messages which are received by the consumer.
