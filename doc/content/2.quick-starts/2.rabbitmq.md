# RabbitMQ Quick Start

This tutorial will get you from zero to up and running with [RabbitMQ](/documentation/transports/rabbitmq) and MassTransit.

:sample{sample=getting-started}

## Prerequisites

::alert{type="success"}
The following instructions assume you are starting from a completed [In-Memory Quick Start](/quick-starts/in-memory)
::

This example requires the following:

- a functioning installation of the .NET Runtime and SDK (at least 6.0)
- a functioning installation of _Docker_ with _Docker Compose_ support enabled.

## Run RabbitMQ

For this quick start, we recommend running the preconfigured [Docker image maintained by the MassTransit team](https://hub.docker.com/r/masstransit/rabbitmq). The container image includes the delayed exchange plug-in and the management interface is enabled.

```bash
$ docker run -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 masstransit/rabbitmq
```

If you are running on an ARM platform

```bash
$ docker run --platform linux/arm64 -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 masstransit/rabbitmq
```

Once its up and running you can [sign in to](http://localhost:15672) the management UI with the username _guest_ and password _guest_. You can see message rates, exchange bindings, and active consumers using the management interface. 

## Configure RabbitMQ

Add the _MassTransit.RabbitMQ_ package to the project.

```bash
$ dotnet add package MassTransit.RabbitMQ
```

### Edit Program.cs

Change _UsingInMemory_ to _UsingRabbitMq_ as shown below.

```csharp
public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
        {
            services.AddMassTransit(x =>
            {
                // elided...

                x.UsingRabbitMq((context,cfg) =>
                {
                    cfg.Host("localhost", "/", h => {
                        h.Username("guest");
                        h.Password("guest");
                    });

                    cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
                });
            });

            services.AddHostedService<Worker>();
        });
```

The host name, _localhost_, is where the docker image is running. We are inferring the default port of _5672_ and are using '/' as the [virtual host](https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.html). The default username _guest_ and default password _guest_ can be used to connect to the broker and sign in to the [management interface](http://localhost:15672).

## Run the Project

```bash
$ dotnet run
```

The output should have changed to show the message consumer generating the output (again, press Control+C to exit). Notice that the bus address now starts with _rabbitmq_.

```
Building...
info: MassTransit[0]
      Configured endpoint Message, Consumer: GettingStarted.MessageConsumer
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Hosting environment: Development
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /Users/chris/Garbage/start/GettingStarted
info: MassTransit[0]
      Bus started: rabbitmq://localhost/
info: GettingStarted.MessageConsumer[0]
      Received Text: The time is 3/24/2021 12:11:10 PM -05:00
```

At this point the service is connecting to RabbitMQ on _localhost_ and publishing messages which are received by the consumer.
