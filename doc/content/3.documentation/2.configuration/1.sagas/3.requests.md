# State Machine Requests

Request/response is easily the most commonly used integration pattern. A service sends a request to another service and continues after receiving the response.
Most of the time, waiting for the response is a _blocking_ operation â€“ the requester waits for the response before it continues processing. In early days of
software development, blocking could limit overall system throughput. However, with modern _async_/_await_ solutions and the .NET Task Parallel Library (TPL),
the impact of waiting is mitigated.

In event-based application, the combination of a _command_ followed by an _event_ usually refines down to the same request/response pattern. In many cases,
the event produced is _only_ interesting to the command's sender.

Saga state machines support request/response, both as a requester and a responder. Unlike the [request client](/documentation/concepts/requests), however,
support for requests is asynchronous at the message-level, eliminating the overhead of _waiting_ for the response. After the request is produced, the saga
state machine instance is persisted. When the response is received, the instance is loaded and the response is consumed by the state machine.


## Declaring Requests

Requests are declared as _public_ properties on the saga state machine with the `Request<TSaga, TRequest, TResponse>` property type where `TSaga` is the saga
state machine instance type and both `TRequest` and `TResponse` are valid message types.

```csharp
public record ValidateOrder(Guid OrderId);
public record OrderValidated(Guid OrderId);

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Request<OrderState, ValidateOrder, OrderValidated> 
        ValidateOrder { get; private set; } = null!;
    
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Request(() => ValidateOrder, o =>
        {
            o.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
        });
    }
}
```

In the example above, `ValidateOrder` is a request to an order validation service that responds with `OrderValidated`. One of three possible outcomes will
happen after the request is produced.

| Event                          | Description                          |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ValidateOrder.Completed`      | The response was received            |
| `ValidateOrder.TimeoutExpired` | The request timed out                |
| `ValidateOrder.Faulted`        | The order validation service faulted |

The request also includes a `ValidateOrder.Pending` state that can optionally be used while the request is pending.

### Request Configuration

The request options can be configured using the configuration callback. In the example above, the `Timeout` option is set. The complete list of request options
includes:

| Property         | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ServiceAddress` | `Uri?`      | If specified, the endpoint address of the request service. If unspecified, the request is published.                                                                                                                              |
| `Timeout`        | `TimeSpan`  | The request timeout. If set to `TimeSpan.Zero`, the request never times out. This is useful for requests that are guaranteed to complete or fault and reduces the load on the message scheduler.                                  |
| `TimeToLive`     | `TimeSpan?` | The request message time-to-live, which is used by the transport to automatically delete the message after the time period elapses. If unspecified, and the `Timeout` is greater than `TimeSpan.Zero`, the timeout value is used. |

### Response Types

Requests usually have a single response, however, up to two additional responses are supported. Additional response types are specified as generic parameters
on the request property.

In the example below, the request includes an additional response type `OrderNotValid`.

```csharp
public record ValidateOrder(Guid OrderId);
public record OrderValidated(Guid OrderId);
public record OrderNotValid(Guid OrderId);

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Request<OrderState, ValidateOrder, OrderValidated, OrderNotValid> 
        ValidateOrder { get; private set; } = null!;
    
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Request(() => ValidateOrder, o =>
        {
            o.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
        });
    }
}
```

### Response Events

Additionally, each request event can be configured allowing complete control over how the response is correlated to the saga state machine instance.

| Property       | Description                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Completed      | The first response event                |
| Completed2     | The second response event, if specified |
| Completed3     | The third response event, if specified  |
| Faulted        | The `Fault<TRequest>` event             |
| TimeoutExpired | The timeout event                       |

This can be useful to configure how an event is configured on the message broker. For example, to remove the response type bindings from the message broker,
the events can be configured with `ConfigureConsumeTopology = false`. Since responses are always _sent_ to the `ResponseAddress` specified by the requester, 
the bindings are not necessary and can be eliminated.

```csharp
public record ValidateOrder(Guid OrderId);
public record OrderValidated(Guid OrderId);

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Request<OrderState, ValidateOrder, OrderValidated> 
        ValidateOrder { get; private set; } = null!;
    
    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Request(() => ValidateOrder, r =>
        {
            r.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
            
            r.Completed = e => e.ConfigureConsumeTopology = false;
            r.Faulted = e => e.ConfigureConsumeTopology = false;
            r.TimeoutExpired = e => e.ConfigureConsumeTopology = false;
        });
    }
}
```

## Sending Requests

To send a request, add a `Request` activity to an event behavior as shown in the example below.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Request<OrderState, ValidateOrder, OrderValidated> 
        ValidateOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        Initially(
            When(OrderSubmitted)
                .Request(ValidateOrder,
                    x => new ValidateOrder(x.Saga.CorrelationId))
                .TransitionTo(ValidateOrder.Pending)
        );
    }
}
```

The request is published with the `RequestId` set the saga state machine instance `CorrelationId` (since no _RequestId_ property was specified) and the
`ResponseAddress` set to the receive endpoint address of the saga state machine.

:::alert{type="info"}
In this example, the `ValidateOrder.Pending` state is used while the request is pending. However, any state defined in the saga state machine can be used.
:::

### Handling Responses

When the response is received, the `Completed` event is triggered. If the order validation service threw an exception, the `Faulted` event is triggered
instead.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Request<OrderState, ValidateOrder, OrderValidated> 
        ValidateOrder { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine()
    {
        During(ValidateOrder.Pending,
            // Handle the valid response
            When(ValidateOrder.Completed)
                .TransitionTo(Completed),

            // Handle a validation fault
            When(ValidateOrder.Faulted)
                .TransitionTo(Failed)
        );
    }
}
```

### Request Overrides

There are many different `Request` method overrides that can be used depending on the features required. A few examples are shown below.

#### Service Address

Specify the service address for the request, optionally using the contents of the saga state machine instance or the event (via `context.Message`).
Useful when the instance stores data about which service should process the request.

```csharp
.Request(ValidateOrder, serviceAddress, 
    context => new ValidateOrder(context.Saga.CorrelationId))

.Request(ValidateOrder, context => context.Saga.ServiceAddress, 
    context => new ValidateOrder(context.Saga.CorrelationId))
```

#### Async Message Factory

The request message can be created asynchronously, if a message initializer is used or when the request message needs data returned by an asynchronous method.

```csharp
.Request(ValidateOrder,  
    async context => new ValidateOrder(context.Saga.CorrelationId))

.Request(ValidateOrder, context => context.Saga.ServiceAddress, 
    async context => new ValidateOrder(context.Saga.CorrelationId))
    
.Request(ValidateOrder, async context => 
{
    await Task.Delay(1); // some async method 
    return new ValidateOrder();
});
```
