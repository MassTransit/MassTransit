# State Machine States

Saga state machines are _stateful_ consumers designed to retain the outcome of preceding events when a subsequent event is consumed. The current state is stored
within a saga state machine instance. A saga state machine instance can only be in one state at a given time.

A newly created saga state machine instance starts in the internally defined `Initial` state. When a saga state machine has completed, an instance should
transition to the `Final` state (which is also already defined).

## Initial State

The `Initial` state is the starting point of all sagas. When an existing saga state machine instance cannot be found that correlates to an event behavior
defined for the _Initial_ state, a new instance is created. The defined behavior should initialize the newly created instance and transition to the next state.

## Final State

The `Final` state is the last (or terminal) state that a saga state machine instance should transition to when the instance has completed. When an instance
is in the _Final_ state no further events should be handled.

#### SetCompletedWhenFinalized

To remove the saga state machine instance from the repository when the instance is in the _Final_ state, specify `SetCompletedWhenFinalized()` in the saga
state machine.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine() 
    {
        SetCompletedWhenFinalized();
    }
}
```

## Declaring States

States are declared as _public_ properties on the saga state machine with the `State` property type. In the example below, two states are defined:
_Submitted_ and _Accepted_.

:::alert{type="info"}
The `MassTransitStateMachine` base class automatically initializes _State_ properties in its constructor, so they don't need to be explicitly initialized.
:::

```csharp
public class OrderState : 
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// The saga state machine instance current state
    /// </summary>
    public string CurrentState { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;
}
```

## Instance State

In the example above, the `CurrentState` property on the saga state machine instance is used to store the instance's current state. The saga state machine
must be configured to use that property.

### String Instance State

The `InstanceState` method is used to configure the property, in the example below the `string` property type is used.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine() 
    {
        InstanceState(x => x.CurrentState);
    }
}
```

### Integer Instance State

In addition to using a `string`, and `int` can also be used to store the current state. An _integer_ can be more efficient to store in a database compared to
a verbose _string_ value. In the example below the `int` property type is used instead.

```csharp
public class OrderState : 
    SagaStateMachineInstance
{
    public Guid CorrelationId { get; set; }

    public int CurrentState { get; set; }
}

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine() 
    {
        InstanceState(x => x.CurrentState, Submitted, Accepted);
    }
}
```

## Transitioning States

When configuring saga state machine behavior for an event, the last activity configured is usually a `TransitionTo` a state. By transitioning to another state,
the saga state machine adapts its behavior so that the next event consumed will pick up in the new state and execute the appropriate behavior for the event
in that state.

For example, when an `OrderSubmitted` event is consumed by a new saga state machine instance, the saga state machine will transition to the `Submitted` state.

```csharp
public record OrderSubmitted(Guid OrderId, string CustomerNumber);

public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public Event OrderSubmitted<OrderSubmitted> { get; private set; } = null!;
    
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine() 
    {
        Initially(
            // Event is consumed, new instance is created in Initial state
            When(OrderSubmitted)
                // copy some data from the event to the saga
                .Then(context => context.Saga.CustomerNumber = context.Message.CustomerNumber)
                // transition to the Submitted state
                .TransitionTo(Submitted)
        );
    }
}
```

### TransitionTo Anti-Pattern

Saga state machine instances are persisted after _all_ state machine activities have completed. If there were additional activities after the `TransitionTo`,
such as a `Publish`, those activities execute before the instance is persisted. After all the activities have completed, the instance is persisted and the
message is acknowledged with the message broker.

In the example below, the newly created saga state machine instance would _not_ be persisted because of the exception thrown by the activity following the first
`TransitionTo` call.

```csharp
public class OrderStateMachine :
    MassTransitStateMachine<OrderState>
{
    public State Submitted { get; private set; } = null!;
    public State Accepted { get; private set; } = null!;

    public OrderStateMachine() 
    {
        Initially(
            When(OnSubmit)
                .Then(context => context.Saga.CustomerNumber = context.Message.CustomerNumber)
                .TransitionTo(Submitted)
                .Then(context => throw new InvalidOperationException()) 
                .TransitionTo(Accepted)
        );
    }
}
```
