To understand routing slips and how to create one, refer to the [Routing Slip](/documentation/concepts/routing-slips) section.

## Configuring Routing Slips

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(cfg => 
{
    // Execute Only Activities
    cfg.AddExecuteActivity<SampleExecuteActivity, SampleAgentArgs>();

    // Activities that have an execute and a compensation
    cfg.AddActivity<SampleCompensatingActivity, SampleCompensatingArgs, SampleCompensatingLog>();

    cfg.Using[Transport]((context, transport) => 
    {
        // Register the Activties with the Transport
        transport.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
    });
})
```
