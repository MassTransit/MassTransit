# Building an Itinerary

On top of creating the various activities, you will also need to build out an itinerary via the `RoutingSlipBuilder`.

| Property | Notes | 
|--|--|
| Tracking Number | A unique identifier to track this specific route |

## Adding an Activity

```csharp
var builder = new RoutingSlipBuilder(NewId.NextGuid());
builder.AddActivity("Name", new Uri("address"), new {
  // args
});
var slip = builder.Build();
```

| Parameter | Notes |
|--|--|
| name | This is a human readable label for the activity | 
| address | The address of the endpoint where the activity is listening. [Short Addresses](/documentation/concepts/producers#short-addresses) are also supported. | 
| args | values to be bound to the Args type defined in this activity, not shared |




## Adding a Variable

```csharp
var builder = new RoutingSlipBuilder(NewId.NextGuid());
builder.AddVariable("Key", "Value")
var slip = builder.Build();
```

These values are shared across activities. This is a great way to pass data from one activity to the next.

| Parameter | Notes |
|--|--|
| key | The key to retrieve it from later | 
| value | The value | 

## Binding Data to Args

When you build a subscription, the `Arg` instance will be created by binding to data in both the variables and the args payload. Any property on your arg class will first get data from the Variables section, and then overridden by the Arg payload.

### Example

```csharp
public record MyCustomArgs(string Name, int Quantity, string Sku);
```


| Property | Variable Value | Argument Value | Resolved Value |
|--|--|--|--|
| Name | "Bob" | undefined | "Bob" | 
| Quantity | undefined | 123 | 123 | 
| Sku | "abc" | "DEF" | "DEF" | 

## Adding a Subscription

By default routing slip events are published. This can cause issues in mature systems. It is recommended
to add a subscription which will configure the events to be sent to the configured endpoint.

```csharp
var builder = new RoutingSlipBuilder(NewId.NextGuid());
builder.AddSubscription(new Uri("address"), RoutingSlipEvents.All)
var slip = builder.Build();
```

| Parameter | Notes |
|--|--|
| address | Where should routing slip events be sent | 
| events | `RoutingSlipEvents` is a flag enum for selecting desired events |
