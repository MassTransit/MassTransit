# Configuration

MassTransit is usable in most .NET application types. MassTransit is easily configured in ASP.NET Core or .NET Generic Host applications (using .NET 6 or later).

To use MassTransit, add the _MassTransit_ package (from NuGet) and start with the _AddMassTransit_ method shown below.

```csharp
using MassTransit;

services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    // A Transport
    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
    });
});
```

In this configuration, the following variables are used:

| Variable  | Type                              | Description                                                                               |
|-----------|:----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x`       | `IBusRegistrationConfigurator`    | Configure the bus instance (not transport specific) and the underlying service collection |
| `context` | `IBusRegistrationContext`         | The configured bus context, also implements `IServiceProvider`                            |
| `cfg`     | `IRabbitMqBusFactoryConfigurator` | Configure the bus specific to the transport (each transport has its own interface type    |

:::alert{type="info"}
The callback passed to the _UsingRabbitMq_ method is invoked after the service collection has been built. Any methods to configure the bus instance (using `x`) should be called outside of this callback.
:::

Adding MassTransit, as shown above, will configure the service collection with required components, including:

 * Several interfaces (and their implementations, appropriate for the transport specified)
   * `IBus` (singleton)
   * `IBusControl` (singleton)
   * `IReceiveEndpointConnector` (singleton)
   * `ISendEndpointProvider` (scoped)
   * `IPublishEndpoint` (scoped)
   * `IRequestClient<T>` (scoped)
 * The bus endpoint with the default settings (not started by default)
 * The _MassTransitHostedService_
 *  Health checks for the bus (or buses) and receive endpoints
 * Using `ILoggerFactory` for log output

> To configure multiple bus instances in the same service collection, refer to the [MultiBus](/documentation/configuration/multibus) section.

## Host Options

MassTransit adds a hosted service so that the generic host can start and stop the bus (or buses, if multiple bus instances are configured). The host options can be configured via _MassTransitHostOptions_ using the _Options_ pattern as shown below.

```csharp
services.AddOptions<MassTransitHostOptions>()
    .Configure(options =>
    {
    });
```

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| WaitUntilStarted    | By default, MassTransit connects to the broker asynchronously. When set to _true_, the MassTransit Hosted Service will block startup until the broker connection has been established.                                                               |
| StartTimeout        | By default, MassTransit waits infinitely until the broker connection is established. If specified, MassTransit will give up after the timeout has expired.                                                                                           |
| StopTimeout         | MassTransit waits infinitely for the bus to stop, including any active message consumers. If specified, MassTransit will force the bus to stop after the timeout has expired.                                                                        |
| ConsumerStopTimeout | If specified, the `ConsumeContext.CancellationToken` will be canceled after the specified timeout when the bus is stopping. This allows long-running consumers to observe the cancellation token and react accordingly. Must be <= the `StopTimeout` |

::callout{type="info"}
#summary
The .NET Generic Host has its own internal shutdown timeout.
#content
To configure the Generic Host options so that the bus has sufficient time to stop, configure the host options as shown.

```csharp
services.Configure<HostOptions>(
    options => options.ShutdownTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1));
```
::

## Transport Options

Each supported transport can be configured via a `.Host()` method or via the .NET [Options Pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options?view=aspnetcore-7.0). 

- Rabbit MQ: [RabbitMqTransportOptions](/documentation/configuration/transports/rabbitmq#transport-options) 
- Azure Service Bus: [AzureServiceBusTransportOptions](documentation/configuration/transports/azure-service-bus#transport-options)
- Amazon SQS: [AmazonSqsTransportOptions](/documentation/configuration/transports/amazon-sqs#transport-options)

## Consumer Registration

To consume messages, one or more consumers must be added and receive endpoints configured for the added consumers. MassTransit connects each receive endpoint to a queue on the message broker.

To add a consumer and automatically configure a receive endpoint for the consumer, call one of the [_AddConsumer_](/documentation/configuration/bus/consumers) methods and call [_ConfigureEndpoints_](documentation/configuration#configure-endpoints) as shown below.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>();
    
    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
    });
});
```

:::alert{type="info"}
**_ConfigureEndpoints_** should be the last method called after all settings and middleware components have been configured.
:::

MassTransit will automatically configure a receive endpoint for the _SubmitOrderConsumer_ using the name returned by the configured endpoint name formatter. When the bus is started, the receive endpoint will be started and messages will be delivered from the queue by the transport to an instance of the consumer.

> All consumer types can be added, including consumers, sagas, saga state machines, and routing slip activities. If a job consumer is added, [additional configuration](/documentation/patterns/job-consumers) is required.

::callout{type="info"}

#content
::div
  :video-player{src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsUlQ93j2MY"}
::
::

To exclude a consumer, saga, or routing slip activity from automatic configuration, use the _ExcludeFromConfigureEndpoints_ extension method when adding the consumer:

```csharp
x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>()
    .ExcludeFromConfigureEndpoints()
```

Alternatively, the _ExcludeFromConfigureEndpoints_ attribute may be specified on the consumer.

```csharp
[ExcludeFromConfigureEndpoints]
public class SubmitOrderConsumer :
    IConsumer<SubmitOrder>
{
}
```

## Configure Endpoints

As shown in the example above, using `ConfigureEndpoints` is the preferred approach to configure receive endpoints. By registering consumers, sagas, and routing slip activities along with their optional definitions, MassTransit is able to configure receive endpoints for all registered consumer types. Receive endpoint names are generated using an [endpoint name formatter](#endpoint-name-formatters) (unless otherwise specified in a definition), and each receive endpoint is configured.

As receive endpoints are configured, one or more consumer types are configured on each receive endpoint. If multiple consumer types share the same endpoint name, those consumer types will be configured on the same receive endpoint. For each consumer type, its respective consumer, saga, or activity definition will be applied to the receive endpoint. 

::alert{type="warning"}
If multiple consumer types share the same receive endpoint, and more than one of those consumer types have a matching definition that specifies the same middleware component, **multiple** filters may be configured! This may lead to unpredictable results, so caution is advised when configuring multiple consumer types on the same receive endpoint.
::

#### Configure Endpoints Callback

To apply receive endpoint settings or configure middleware for all receive endpoints configured by `ConfigureEndpoints`, a callback can be added.

```csharp
x.AddConfigureEndpointsCallback((name, cfg) =>
{
    cfg.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Immediate(2));
});
```

When `ConfigureEndpoints` is called, any registered callbacks will be called for every recieve endpoint endpoint. Each callback will only be called _once_ per receive endpoint.

To conditionally apply transport-specific settings, the `cfg` parameter can be pattern-matched to the transport type as shown below.

```csharp
x.AddConfigureEndpointsCallback((name, cfg) =>
{
    if (cfg is IRabbitMqReceiveEndpointConfigurator rmq)
        rmq.SetQuorumQueue(3);
        
    cfg.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Immediate(2));        
});
```

## Endpoint Strategies 

Deciding how to configure receive endpoints in your application can be easy or hard, depending upon how much energy you want to spend being concerned with things that usually don't matter. However, there are nuances to the following approaches that should be considered. 

#### One Consumer for Each Queue 

Creates a queue for each registered consumer, saga, and routing slip activity. Separate queues are created for execute and compensate if compensation is supported by the activity. 

::alert{type="info"}
This is the preferred approach since it ensures that every consumer can be configured independently, including retries, delivery, and the outbox. It also ensures that messages for a consumer are not stuck behind other messages for other consumers sharing the same queue. 
::
 
#### Multiple Consumers on a Single Queue 

Configuring multiple consumers, while fully supported by MassTransit, may make sense in certain circumstances, however, proceed with caution as there are limitations to this approach.  

The recommendation here is to configure multiple consumers on a single queue only when those consumers are closely related in terms of business function and each consumer consumes distinct message types. An example might be consumers that each create, update, or delete an entity when the dependencies of those operations are different – create and update may depend upon a validation component, while delete may not share that dependency. 

##### Consume Multiple Message Types 

In situations where it is preferable to consume multiple message types from a single queue, create a consumer that consumes multiple message types by adding more IConsumer<T> interface implementations to the consumer class.

```csharp
public class AddressConsumer :
    IConsumer<CreateAddress>,
    IConsumer<UpdateAddress>
{
}
```

Sagas follow this approach, creating a single queue for each saga and configuring the broker to route message types consumed by the saga that are published to topic/exchanges to the saga’s queue. 

#### All Consumers on a Single Queue 

This is never a good idea and is highly discouraged. While it is supported by MassTransit, it’s unlikely to be operationally sustainable.  

Routing slip activities must not be configured on a single queue as they will not work properly. 

 


## Endpoint Name Formatters

_ConfigureEndpoints_ uses an `IEndpointNameFormatter` to format the queue names for all supported consumer types. The default endpoint name formatter returns _PascalCase_ class names without the namespace. There are several built-in endpoint name formatters included. For the _SubmitOrderConsumer_, the receive endpoint names would be formatted as shown below. Note that class suffixes such as _Consumer_, _Saga_, and _Activity_ are trimmed from the endpoint name by default.

| Format     | Configuration                       | Name           |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------|:---------------|
| Default    | `SetDefaultEndpointNameFormatter`   | `SubmitOrder`  |
| Snake Case | `SetSnakeCaseEndpointNameFormatter` | `submit_order` |
| Kebab Case | `SetKebabCaseEndpointNameFormatter` | `submit-order` |

The endpoint name formatters can also be customized by constructing a new instance and configuring MassTransit to use it.

```csharp
x.SetEndpointNameFormatter(new KebabCaseEndpointNameFormatter(prefix: "Dev", includeNamespace: false));
```

By specifying a prefix, the endpoint name would be `dev-submit-order`. This is useful when sharing a single broker with multiple developers (Amazon SQS is account-wide, for instance).

::callout{type="info"}
#summary
When using MultiBus with different endpoint name formatters for each bus... 
#content
Specify the endpoint name formatter when calling `ConfigureEndpoints` as shown. 
```csharp
cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context, new KebabCaseEndpointNameFormatter(prefix: "Mobile", includeNamespace: false));
```
::

## Receive Endpoints

The previous examples use conventions to configure receive endpoints. Alternatively, receive endpoints can be explicitly configured. 

> When configuring endpoints manually, _ConfigureEndpoints_ should be excluded or be called **after** any explicitly configured receive endpoints.

To explicitly configure endpoints, use the _ConfigureConsumer_ or _ConfigureConsumers_ method.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>();
    
    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.ReceiveEndpoint("order-service", e =>
        {
            e.ConfigureConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>(context);
        });
    });
});
```

Receive endpoints have transport-independent settings that can be configured.

| Name                     | Description                                                                                             | Default                                                                   |
|:-------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PrefetchCount            | Number of unacknowledged messages delivered by the broker                                               | max(CPU Count x 2,16)                                                     |
| ConcurrentMessageLimit   | Number of concurrent messages delivered to consumers                                                    | (none, uses PrefetchCount)                                                |
| ConfigureConsumeTopology | Create exchanges/topics on the broker and bind them to the receive endpoint                             | true                                                                      |
| ConfigureMessageTopology | Create exchanges/topics on the broker and bind them to the receive endpoint for a specific message type | true                                                                      |
| PublishFaults            | Publish `Fault<T>` events when consumers fault                                                          | true                                                                      |
| DefaultContentType       | The default content type for received messages                                                          | See [serialization](configuration/integrations/serialization#serializers) |
| SerializerContentType    | The default content type for sending/publishing messages                                                | See [serialization](configuration/integrations/serialization#serializers) |

> The _PrefetchCount_, _ConcurrentMessageLimit_, and serialization settings can be specified at the bus level and will be applied to all receive endpoints.

In the following example, the _PrefetchCount_ is set to 32 and the _ConcurrentMessageLimit_ is set to 28.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>();
    
    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.PrefetchCount = 32; // applies to all receive endpoints
        
        cfg.ReceiveEndpoint("order-service", e =>
        {
            e.ConcurrentMessageLimit = 28; // only applies to this endpoint
            e.ConfigureConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>(context);
        });
    });
});
```

> When using _ConfigureConsumer_ with a consumer that has a definition, the _EndpointName_, _PrefetchCount_, and _Temporary_ properties of the consumer definition are not used.

### Temporary Endpoints

Some consumers only need to receive messages while connected, and any messages published while disconnected should be discarded. This can be achieved by using a TemporaryEndpointDefinition to configure the receive endpoint.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>();

    x.UsingInMemory((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.ReceiveEndpoint(new TemporaryEndpointDefinition(), e =>
        {
            e.ConfigureConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer>(context);
        });

        cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
    });
});
```

### Consumer Definition

A consumer definition is used to configure the receive endpoint and pipeline behavior for the consumer. When scanning assemblies or namespaces for consumers, consumer definitions are also found and added to the container. The _SubmitOrderConsumer_ and matching definition are shown below.

```csharp
class SubmitOrderConsumer :
    IConsumer<SubmitOrder>
{
    readonly ILogger<SubmitOrderConsumer> _logger;

    public SubmitOrderConsumer(ILogger<SubmitOrderConsumer> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<SubmitOrder> context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Order Submitted: {OrderId}", context.Message.OrderId);

        await context.Publish<OrderSubmitted>(new
        {
            context.Message.OrderId
        });
    }
}

class SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition :
    ConsumerDefinition<SubmitOrderConsumer>
{
    public SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition()
    {
        // override the default endpoint name
        EndpointName = "order-service";

        // limit the number of messages consumed concurrently
        // this applies to the consumer only, not the endpoint
        ConcurrentMessageLimit = 8;
    }

    protected override void ConfigureConsumer(IReceiveEndpointConfigurator endpointConfigurator,
        IConsumerConfigurator<SubmitOrderConsumer> consumerConfigurator, IRegistrationContext context)
    {
        // configure message retry with millisecond intervals
        endpointConfigurator.UseMessageRetry(r => r.Intervals(100,200,500,800,1000));

        // use the outbox to prevent duplicate events from being published
        endpointConfigurator.UseInMemoryOutbox(context);
    }
}
```

### Endpoint Configuration

To configure the endpoint for a consumer registration, or override the endpoint configuration in the definition, the `Endpoint` method can be added to the consumer registration. This will create an endpoint definition for the consumer, and register it in the container. This method is available on consumer and saga registrations, with separate execute and compensate endpoint methods for activities.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer, SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition>()
        .Endpoint(e =>
        {
            // override the default endpoint name
            e.Name = "order-service-extreme";
            
            // more options shown below
        });

    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) => cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context));
});
```

The configurable settings for an endpoint include:

| Property                       | Type     | Description                                                                                            |
|:-------------------------------|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`                         | `string` | The receive endpoint (queue) name                                                                      |
| `InstanceId`                   | `string` | If specified, should be unique for each bus instance To enable fan-out (instead of load balancing)     |
| `Temporary`                    | `bool`   | If true, the endpoint will be automatically removed after the bus has stopped.                         |
| `PrefetchCount`                | `int`    | Number of unacknowledged messages delivered by the broker                                              | 
| `ConcurrentMessageLimit`       | `int?`   | Number of concurrent messages delivered to consumers                                                   | 
| `ConfigureConsumeTopology`     | `bool`   | Create exchanges/topics on the broker and bind them to the receive endpoint                            | 
| `AddConfigureEndpointCallback` | delegate | (Added in v8.3.0) Adds a callback method that will be invoked when the receive endpoint is configured. | 

#### Endpoint Naming

When the endpoint is configured after the _AddConsumer_ method, the configuration then overrides the endpoint configuration in the consumer definition. However, it cannot override the `EndpointName` if it is specified in the constructor. The order of precedence for endpoint naming is explained below.

1. Specifying `EndpointName = "submit-order-extreme"` in the constructor which cannot be overridden

    ```csharp
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer, SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition>()

    public SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition()
    {
        EndpointName = "submit-order-extreme";
    }
    ```

2. Specifying `.Endpoint(x => x.Name = "submit-order-extreme")` in the consumer registration, chained to `AddConsumer`

    ```csharp
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer, SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition>()
        .Endpoint(x => x.Name = "submit-order-extreme");

    public SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition()
    {
        Endpoint(x => x.Name = "not used");
    }
    ```

3. Specifying `Endpoint(x => x.Name = "submit-order-extreme")` in the constructor, which creates an endpoint definition

    ```csharp
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer, SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition>()

    public SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition()
    {
        Endpoint(x => x.Name = "submit-order-extreme");
    }
    ```

4. Unspecified, the endpoint name formatter is used (in this case, the endpoint name is `SubmitOrder` using the default formatter)

    ```csharp
    x.AddConsumer<SubmitOrderConsumer, SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition>()

    public SubmitOrderConsumerDefinition()
    {
    }
    ```

## Saga Registration

To add a state machine saga, use the _AddSagaStateMachine_ methods. For a consumer saga, use the _AddSaga_ methods.

::alert{type="success"}
State machine sagas should be added before class-based sagas, and the class-based saga methods should not be used to add state machine sagas. This may be simplified in the future, but for now, be aware of this registration requirement.
::

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(r =>
{
    // add a state machine saga, with the in-memory repository
    r.AddSagaStateMachine<OrderStateMachine, OrderState>()
        .InMemoryRepository();

    // add a consumer saga with the in-memory repository
    r.AddSaga<OrderSaga>()
        .InMemoryRepository();

    // add a saga by type, without a repository. The repository should be registered
    // in the container elsewhere
    r.AddSaga(typeof(OrderSaga));

    // add a state machine saga by type, including a saga definition for that saga
    r.AddSagaStateMachine(typeof(OrderState), typeof(OrderStateDefinition))

    // add all saga state machines by type
    r.AddSagaStateMachines(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());

    // add all sagas in the specified assembly
    r.AddSagas(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());

    // add sagas from the namespace containing the type
    r.AddSagasFromNamespaceContaining<OrderSaga>();
    r.AddSagasFromNamespaceContaining(typeof(OrderSaga));
});
```

To add a saga registration and configure the consumer endpoint in the same expression, a definition can automatically be created.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(r =>
{
    r.AddSagaStateMachine<OrderStateMachine, OrderState>()
        .NHibernateRepository()
        .Endpoint(e =>
        {
            e.Name = "order-state";
            e.ConcurrentMessageLimit = 8;
        });
});
```

Supported saga persistence storage engines are documented in the [saga documentation](/documentation/patterns/saga/) section.


```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<ValueEnteredEventConsumer>();

    x.SetKebabCaseEndpointNameFormatter();

    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.ConfigureEndpoints(context);
    });
});
```

And the consumer: 

```csharp
class ValueEnteredEventConsumer :
    IConsumer<ValueEntered>
{
    ILogger<ValueEnteredEventConsumer> _logger;

    public ValueEnteredEventConsumer(ILogger<ValueEnteredEventConsumer> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<ValueEntered> context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Value: {Value}", context.Message.Value);
    }
}
```

An ASP.NET Core application can also configure receive endpoints. The consumer, along with the receive endpoint, is configured within the _AddMassTransit_ configuration. Separate registration of the consumer is not required (and discouraged), however, any consumer dependencies should be added to the container separately. Consumers are registered as scoped, and dependencies should be registered as scoped when possible, unless they are singletons.

```csharp
services.AddMassTransit(x =>
{
    x.AddConsumer<EventConsumer>();

    x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
    {
        cfg.ReceiveEndpoint("event-listener", e =>
        {
            e.ConfigureConsumer<EventConsumer>(context);
        });
    });
});
```

```csharp
class EventConsumer :
    IConsumer<ValueEntered>
{
    ILogger<EventConsumer> _logger;

    public EventConsumer(ILogger<EventConsumer> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Consume(ConsumeContext<ValueEntered> context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Value: {Value}", context.Message.Value);
    }
}
```

## Health Checks

The _AddMassTransit_ method adds an `IHealthCheck` to the service collection that you can use to monitor your health. The health check is added with the tags `ready` and `masstransit`.


To configure health checks, map the ready and live endpoints in your ASP.NET application.

```csharp
app.MapHealthChecks("/health/ready", new HealthCheckOptions()
{
    Predicate = (check) => check.Tags.Contains("ready"),
});

app.MapHealthChecks("/health/live", new HealthCheckOptions());
```

**Example Output**

```json
{
  "status": "Healthy",
  "totalDuration": "00:00:00.2134026",
  "entries": {
    "masstransit-bus": {
      "data": {
        "Endpoints": {
          "rabbitmq://localhost/dev-local/SubmitOrder": {
            "status": "Healthy",
            "description": "ready"
          }
        }
      },
      "description": "Ready",
      "duration": "00:00:00.1853530",
      "status": "Healthy",
      "tags": [
        "ready",
        "masstransit"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- When everything works correctly, MassTransit will report `Healthy`.
- If any problems occur on application startup, MassTransit will report `Unhealthy`. This can cause an orcestrator to restart your application.
- If any problems occur while the application is working (for example, application loses connection to broker), MassTransit will report `Degraded`. 

### Health Check Options

Health Checks can be further configured using _ConfigureHealthCheckOptions_:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddMassTransit(bus =>
{
    bus.ConfigureHealthCheckOptions(options =>
    {
        options.Name = "masstransit";
        options.MinimalFailureStatus = HealthStatus.Unhealthy;
        options.Tags.Add("health");
    });

}
```

| Setting              | Description                                                                    | Default value          |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| Name                 | Set the health check name, overrides the default bus type name.                | Bus name.              |
| MinimalFailureStatus | The minimal `HealthStatus` that will be reported when the health check fails.  | `Unhealthy`            |
| Tags                 | A list of tags that can be used to filter sets of health checks.               | "ready", "masstransit" |

By default MassTransit reports all three statuses depending on application state.
If `MinimalFailureStatus` is set to `Healthy`, MassTransit will log any issues, but the health check will always report `Healthy`.
If `MinimalFailureStatus` is set to `Degraded`, MassTransit will report `Degraded` if any issues occur, but never report `Unhealthy`.

Tags inside options will override default tags. You will need to add `ready` and `masstransit` tags manually if you want to keep them.
