# Announcing MassTransit v9

## A New Era for Enterprise Messaging

For over a decade, MassTransit has been the leading open-source .NET messaging framework, trusted by thousands developers and enterprises worldwide to build
scalable, distributed applications. It has facilitated billions of transactions, powered mission-critical systems in finance, healthcare, government, and
logistics, and seamlessly integrated with cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. As adoption has surged and enterprise demand has grown,
MassTransit has evolved into a cornerstone of modern event-driven architectures. Today, we’re excited to share an important milestone!

### We are transitioning to a commercial model.

With MassTransit v9, we are transitioning to a commercial licensing model. This change ensures long-term sustainability, continued innovation, and
enterprise-grade support — while leaving MassTransit v8 open-source and available to the community.

## Why the Change?

When MassTransit first started in 2007, it was a single assembly that supported MSMQ. Fast-forward to today, and MassTransit has extensive support for several
message brokers, multiple databases, powerful capabilities including saga state machines, job consumers, message scheduling, and routing slips, as well as its
own SQL-based message transport. The entire solution builds and deploys over thirty NuGet packages.

Because of its extensive capabilities, MassTransit has grown into a mission-critical foundation for organizations worldwide. Trusted by enterprises in more than
100 countries across industries including finance, healthcare, logistics, and government. As adoption has surged, so has the need for:

- Dedicated, full-time development resources to enhance and maintain the platform.
- Enterprise-grade support and guarantees for business-critical applications.
- A sustainable, long-term funding model to drive continuous innovation.

By making v9 a commercial release, we can accelerate MassTransit’s evolution, delivering even better scalability, security, and performance — while continuing
to support the existing community.

### Change is Hard, Why Now?

We know that change — especially in the open-source world — can be challenging. If you’ve been relying on MassTransit as a free and open solution, you might be
wondering what this shift means for you and your team. We want to be clear: we deeply appreciate the community that has helped make MassTransit what it is
today. This decision wasn’t made lightly, but rather with the long-term success and sustainability of the project in mind.

By moving to a commercial model for v9, we’re ensuring that MassTransit can continue to evolve, with dedicated resources, faster development cycles, and the
enterprise support that many organizations have been asking for. MassTransit v8 remains open-source, and we’re committed to making this transition as smooth
as possible. Our goal isn’t to take something away — but to build something even better, with the stability and support that businesses need. We’re here to
help, and we welcome your questions, feedback, and thoughts as we move forward together.
