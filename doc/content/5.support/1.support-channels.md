# Support Channels

Community support is offered through the following channels. These channels are monitored regularly, but response time is not guaranteed. If you need immediate help with MassTransit, consider [Commercial Support](/support).

## GitHub Discussions

Questions, ideas, and suggestions can be posted on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/MassTransit/MassTransit/discussions). This is a great place to post code samples, share ideas, and get help using MassTransit. 

Before you post, however, spend a few moments to compose your thoughts and formulate your question. There is nothing as pointless as simply telling us "MassTransit does not work for me" with no further information to give any clue to why. Before you post, search the web to see if your question has already been asked or even answered. And if it has been, you will already have your answer.

> If you have an issue _using_ MassTransit, this is the place to start **before** creating an issue.

## GitHub Issues

Please **do not open an issue on GitHub**, unless you have spotted an actual bug in MassTransit. If you are unsure, first create a discussion. If we confirm it's a bug, we'll ask you to [create the issue][3], or we will create the issue from the discussion itself.

**Issues are not the place for questions, and they'll likely be closed.**

This policy is in place to avoid bugs being drowned out in a pile of sensible suggestions for future enhancements and calls for help from people who forget to check back if they get it and so on.

## Discord

MassTransit has an active Discord server, which is a great place to get quick answers to short questions as well as share in engaging conversations about MassTransit, messaging, or whatever.

## YouTube

There are several seasons of videos [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8uyNNs1ri2MBx6BjPum5j9_MMdIfM9C), and new episodes are added fairly regularly. There are also many short-format [Commutes](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8uyNNs1ri2_ldsW1aPb7_8E2FI7ZtaI) that cover quick topics.
