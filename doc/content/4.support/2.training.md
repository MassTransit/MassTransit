## Getting Started: Messaging in .NET with MassTransit

This course starts with no assumed knowledge of messaging and guides you through everything you need to get started with asynchronous messaging in .NET with MassTransit.

You start with a traditional RESTful API, and make the necessary changes to evolve the project to a modern one, focusing on messaging.
The course walks you through the concepts step-by-step, and you learn by implementing them yourself with MassTransit.
