<h2>END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ACTIPRO SOFTWARE LLC SOFTWARE</h2>

<hr><b>
IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This Actipro Software LLC ("Actipro") End-User License Agreement ("EULA") 
is a legal agreement between you (“Licensee”), a developer of software applications, and Actipro for the Actipro software product 
accompanying this EULA, which includes computer software and may include associated source code, media, printed materials, 
and "on-line" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT"). By installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, 
you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install, use, distribute 
in any manner, or replicate in any manner, any part, file or portion of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
</b><hr>

<p>
The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.  
</p>

<p>
The Licensee is considered to be an authorized licensee (“Authorized”) if the Licensee has legitimately obtained a registered license for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT from Actipro or an authorized Actipro reseller.
</p>

<p>
<b>RIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</b> 
If the licensed right of use for this SOFTWARE PRODUCT is purchased by the Licensee with any intent to reverse engineer, 
decompile, create derivative works, and the exploitation or unauthorized transfer of, any Actipro intellectual property and 
trade secrets, to include any exposed methods or source code where provided, no licensed right of use shall exist, and any products 
created as a result shall be judged illegal by definition of all applicable law. Any sale or resale of intellectual property or 
created derivatives so obtained will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of all local, federal and international law. 
</p>

<p>
<b>GRANT OF LICENSE.</b> This EULA, if legally executed as defined herein, licenses and so grants the Licensee the following rights: 
</p>

<p>
<b>Evaluation.</b> If the downloaded SOFTWARE PRODUCT is designated as an Evaluation Release (“Evaluation Release”),
the Licensee is granted a license for a period of only fifteen (15) days after installation of the Evaluation Release 
of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Evaluation Period"). After the Evaluation Period, the Licensee must either: 
<ol>
<li>Delete the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and all related files from ALL computers onto which it was installed or copied, or</li>
<li>Contact Actipro or one of its authorized resellers to purchase the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The Licensee may use the Evaluation Release of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for evaluation purposes only.  
The Licensee may not distribute ANY of the files, in any form or manner, provided with the Evaluation Release of the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT to ANY PARTIES. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Development.</b> Actipro grants the Licensee the non-exclusive license to install and use multiple copies of the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT or any prior version for the sole purpose of developing any number of end user applications that 
operate in conjunction with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.  If the Licensee is not Authorized, the Licensee may not use the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT beyond the Evaluation Period.
</p>

<p>
If the Licensee has purchased a single developer license (“Single Developer License”), the Licensee is Authorized 
to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT indefinitely beyond the Evaluation Period.  A Single Developer License for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT 
may not be shared or used concurrently by more than one individual developer.  In a project that uses the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, 
each individual developer on the project requires a separate Single Developer License, regardless of whether they directly 
use the component or not.  Single Developer Licenses may also be obtained in team discount packs. 
</p>

<p>
If the Licensee has purchased a site license (“Site License”), each of the developers at a single physical location is 
considered Authorized according to the terms and conditions of the Single Developer License.  Each additional physical 
location requires an additional Site License to be considered Authorized.
</p>

<p>
If the Licensee has purchased an enterprise license (“Enterprise License”), all developers in the Licensee's organization, 
regardless of location, are considered Authorized according to the terms and conditions of the Single Developer License.  
</p>

<p>
If the Licensee has purchased a blueprint license (“Blueprint License”), each of the Authorized developers for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is 
considered Authorized to access source code for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Source Code").
The Blueprint License must be purchased at the same time as a Site License or Enterprise License.
Source Code may exclude Actipro proprietary licensing code.  
The sale of Blueprint Licenses is considered final and neither the SOFTWARE PRODUCT nor Source Code may be returned under any circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<b>Duplication and Distribution.</b> The SOFTWARE PRODUCT may include certain files ("Redistributables") intended for distribution 
by the Licensee to the users of programs the Licensee creates. Redistributables include, for example, those files identified in 
printed or electronic documentation as redistributable files, or those files pre-selected for deployment by an install utility 
provided with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (if any).  In any event, the Redistributables for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT are only those files 
specifically designated as such by Actipro.
</p>

<p>
Subject to all of the terms and conditions in this EULA, if the Licensee is Authorized, Actipro grants the Licensee the non-exclusive, 
royalty-free license to duplicate the Redistributables and to distribute them solely in conjunction with software products 
developed by the Licensee that use them.  The Licensee may not supply any means by which end users could incorporate the 
SOFTWARE PRODUCT or portions thereof into their own products.
</p>

<p>
<b>Source Code.</b> If the Licensee has purchased a Blueprint License and is Authorized, the Licensee is provided Source Code 
for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.  The following stipulations and restrictions apply to Source Code: 
<ol>
<li>Source Code shall be considered as part the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and all requirements stated above still apply, 
		meaning that developers at a separate site from the one which purchased the Blueprint License are NOT able to work on 
		any project created that uses the Source Code, unless that site has also purchased a Blueprint License.
		The only exception is when an Enterprise License has been purchased along with the Blueprint License, 
		in which case the Source Code may be used by developers at any site.</li>
<li>Actipro grants the Licensee the non-exclusive license to view and modify the Source Code for the sole purposes of education and troubleshooting.  
		If the Licensee troubleshoots the Source Code, the Licensee may compile the corrected source code and use and distribute the 
		resulting object code solely as a replacement for the corresponding Redistributables the Source Code compiles into.</li>
<li>The Licensee may NOT distribute or sell the Source Code, or portions or modifications or derivative works thereof, to any third party 
		not Authorized by the Licensee’s Blueprint License(s), without explicit permission by Actipro.</li>
<li>The Licensee may not compete against Actipro by repackaging, recompiling, or renaming the SOFTWARE PRODUCT for which the 
		Licensee purchased Source Code.  Any derivative works based on the Source Code are illegal to be created or sold if they compete 
		in any way with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or other Actipro products.</li>
<li>Any object code that is created by using the Source Code or derivative code based on the Source Code must be obfuscated.</li>
<li>Any object code that is created by using the Source Code or derivative code based on the Source Code may NOT bear "ActiproSoftware" 
		or the name of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT in the object code assembly name.</li>
<li>All Source Code must be kept in its proper "ActiproSoftware" namespace.</li>
<li>Actipro shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to all corrections, modifications and derivative works of the Source Code 
		created by the Licensee, including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the extent such corrections, modifications or 
		derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the Source Code.</li>
<li>The Licensee acknowledges that the Source Code contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of Actipro, and agrees to expend 
		every effort to insure its confidentiality.</li>
<li>Source Code may be obtained by coordinating with Actipro during the support period for the Blueprint License, typically one year 
		in duration, starting on the date of purchase of the Blueprint License.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Storage/Network Use.</b> The Licensee may also store or install a copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on a storage device, 
such as a network server, used only to install or run the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the the Licensee’s other computers over an internal network; 
however, the Licensee must acquire and dedicate a Single Developer License for each separate individual developer who wishes to use 
the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
